# User Stories

Produces a prioritized backlog of INVEST-compliant user stories, each estimated for effort and impact and carrying a pragmatic functional Definition of Done, then saved to the project's configured tracker.

## Actions

| #   | Action            | Role                                                                 | Input                                  |
| --- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 01  | `clarify-scope`   | Clarify the request through Product Owner questioning; decide epic vs single story | feature or epic description            |
| 02  | `split-epic`      | Decompose the confirmed scope into candidate vertical-slice stories  | confirmed scope from 01                |
| 03  | `draft-stories`   | Write each candidate as an INVEST story with acceptance criteria and a functional DoD | candidate stories from 02              |
| 04  | `estimate-impact` | Rate each story for effort (points) and impact on the existing system | drafted stories from 03                |
| 05  | `prioritize`      | Rank the backlog by value against effort and impact                  | estimated stories from 04              |
| 06  | `sync-tracker`    | Gate on Definition of Ready, get explicit approval, save to the tracker | ranked backlog from 05                 |

Run `01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06`, passing each `## Test` first. A single story skips the epic split.

## Transversal rules

- **INVEST**: each story is Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
- **Definition of Ready**: acceptance criteria, dependencies, story points, and an impact rating are set, with zero blocking questions, before save.
- **Definition of Done**: each story carries a pragmatic, functional DoD, observable user-facing conditions that mean the goal is met. Functional only, never technical delivery steps.
- **Lean clarification**: at most 3 questions per iteration; focus on user needs, not technical aspects.
- Always wait for explicit user validation before saving to the tracker.
- The save target is the configured ticketing tool from project memory; never assume a specific tool.
