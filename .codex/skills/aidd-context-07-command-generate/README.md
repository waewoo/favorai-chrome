# 07 - command-generate

Write one canonical slash command from intent and render it once per host AI tool that supports commands. A sibling of `04-skill-generate` for the command artifact.

## When to use

- The user wants to create, scaffold, or refactor a one-shot slash command.
- Not for multi-step skills (use the skill generator) or other artifacts (rules, agents, hooks).
