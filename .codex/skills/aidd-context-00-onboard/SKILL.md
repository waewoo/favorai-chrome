# Onboard

A plain-language guide to the AIDD framework for the current project. It reads the project lightly, explains where the project sits in the AIDD flow, and suggests the next logical step using only the plugins that are installed. It loops until the user stops.

## Actions

| #   | Action         | Role                                                              | Input             |
| --- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 01  | `read-project` | Read the project once into a silent snapshot: signals, ledger, installed skills | project root      |
| 02  | `orient`       | Place the project, then offer a project-adapted, plain-language menu | the snapshot from 01 |
| 03  | `act`          | Run the suggestion, explain it, teach the flow, switch step, or stop | the user's choice |

Run `01 → 02 → 03`, then loop back to `01` after each step until the user stops. Run each action's `## Test` before the next.

## Transversal rules

- Teach, do not assume. The user may be new to AIDD. Explain a term the first time it appears (the memory bank is the project memory the AI loads each session), never assume framework literacy.
- Suggest, never force. Show where the project seems to stand and the next logical step, and always let the user choose another. A foundation step (architect a stack, set up the memory bank) may be the loud, pre-selected default, but it is always skippable, and a skipped step is remembered for the session.
- Plain language only. No internal state names, no raw phase labels, no signal dump reaches the user. The user reads guidance, not a state machine.
- Adapt to what is installed. Suggest by function and resolve it to a skill that is actually installed. If none is installed, name the missing capability by function, never invent a skill.
- Silent read. `01-read-project` prints nothing. The first visible output is the plain briefing from `02-orient`.
- Read once, then refresh on action. Read the project once into a reusable snapshot; after the user runs a step, re-derive the changed facts and mark that step done in the session ledger; a read-only choice reuses the snapshot. The ledger is how onboard knows a step is done even when it leaves no file behind.
- Wait for an explicit reply between prompts. Never auto-advance.
