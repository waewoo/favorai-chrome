description: <Verb-led, what the skill produces, one clause>. Use when the user wants to <distinct intents>. <Optional: "Not for <X>" in plain words when a sibling could mis-trigger.> (Two lines max, ~240 chars, straight to the point. Third person, no XML. Never name another skill, never write a /command token. All "when" lives here, not in the body.)

# <Skill Name>

<1 sentence: what running this skill produces.>

## Actions

<One row per action: # | slug | one-line role | required input.>

| #   | Action   | Role            | Input   |
| --- | -------- | --------------- | ------- |
| 01  | `<slug>` | <one-line role> | <input> |

<Flow line, one concise sentence: a chain (`01 → 02 → 03`, test each before the next), or independent actions (the router runs the one matching the intent, or several together when asked).>
<Optional, if it delegates: `Spawn the `<agent>` agent to run this skill.`>

## Assets       files the actions COPY or INJECT (templates, fixed snippets).
List ONLY global includes (used skill-wide). An action-specific include lives with its action and carries that action's slug prefix (R13).

## Transversal rules   rules applying to every action that are NOT already owned by a reference.
