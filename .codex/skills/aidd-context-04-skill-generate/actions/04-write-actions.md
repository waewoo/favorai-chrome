# 04 - Write action files

One file per action in the plan, under each confirmed tool's skills root.

## Input

From 02 the plan, from 03 the files written, from 01 where to write.

## Output

One file per action, per confirmed tool, at `<skills root>/<name>/actions/<NN>-<slug>.md`.

## Process

1. **Resolve.** Host mode: for each confirmed tool, resolve the skills root from `[references/tool-paths.md](../references/tool-paths.md)`. Plugin source: use `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/`.
2. **Fill.** For each action, fill `[assets/action-template.md](../assets/action-template.md)`: strip the scaffold (comments + `<...>`), copy the test from 02 verbatim into `## Test`.
3. **Sync hint.** When the parent SKILL.md accepts `argument-hint` and has two or more actions, update it from the final action file names only, joined with ` | `. Omit it for one-action skills. In this repository, run `node scripts/sync-skill-argument-hints.mjs`; otherwise edit the field directly.
   - Modify: write only the changed actions, leave the rest untouched.
4. **Compose.** Include any template or reference via `@<path>`. Never "read X then apply".
5. **Validate.** Run the write-target validation (`[references/tool-paths.md](../references/tool-paths.md)`).

## Test

- Each action file exists and carries `## Output`, `## Process`, `## Test`.
- One-action skills omit `argument-hint`. When present, the parent SKILL.md `argument-hint` lists the same action names as the action files.
- Each sits under the target base.
