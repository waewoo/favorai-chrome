# 10 - todo

Split one prompt into independent todos, run one executor agent per
todo in parallel (each refines its todo before coding), and report a
minimal table: category, what was launched, output.

## When to use

- The user says "todo" or `/todo`.
- A single prompt bundles several independent tasks that can be
  implemented in parallel.

## Actions
