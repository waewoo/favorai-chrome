# 04 - Plan

Turn the explored source into a plan and its phases, save them, then review the whole until approved. Never code.

## Input

The explore output from `02-explore` (projection, rules, feasibility, risks), plus any confirmed wireframe from `03-wireframe`.

## Output

A feature folder, always at `aidd_docs/tasks/<yyyy_mm>/<yyyy_mm_dd>_<feature-slug>/`, holding `plan.md` from `[assets/plan-template.md](../assets/plan-template.md)` and one `phase-<n>.md` per phase from `[assets/phase-template.md](../assets/phase-template.md)`.

## Process

1. **Phases.** Break the work into phases, each a coherent unit of work that ships and verifies on its own, sized for one executor pass. Let the work decide how many.
2. **Folder.** Reuse the feature folder the source already lives in, or create one.
3. **Fill.** Scaffold from the templates, filling only what qualifies and omitting any section whose bar nothing meets. Slice the projection across the phases. Resources lists external sources only, not code files. Decisions holds architecture-magnitude choices only. Keep a phase's Wireframe only when that phase ships UI.
4. **Show.** Display the written paths.
5. **Review.** Show the complete plan and its phases with a confidence score (0 to 10, ✓ reasons and ✗ risks). Take feedback, revise the files, and re-show until approved. The score is never written to the plan.

## Test

- `aidd_docs/tasks/<yyyy_mm>/<yyyy_mm_dd>_<feature-slug>/plan.md` exists with one `phase-<n>.md` per phase next to it.
- No `{...}` placeholder is left in any written file.
- The phase projection slices together cover the modify, create, and delete lists.
- A confidence score was reported and written to no file.
