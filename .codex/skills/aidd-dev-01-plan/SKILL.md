# Skill: plan

Turn a gathered source into an implementation plan and its phase files. Never writes code.

## Actions

| #   | Action      | Role                                                 | Input                      |
| --- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 01  | `gather`    | Collect and restate the source                       | user request               |
| 02  | `explore`   | Read the codebase for projection, rules, feasibility | gathered source            |
| 03  | `wireframe` | Sketch a screen at low fidelity, frontend only       | source + explore context   |
| 04  | `plan`      | Break into phases, write the plan and phase files    | explore output + wireframe |

Run them in order, `01 → 04`. The plan is the culmination. Skip `03` when there is no UI.
