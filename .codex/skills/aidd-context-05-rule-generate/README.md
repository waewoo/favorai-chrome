# 08 - rule-generate

Write one canonical coding rule from intent and render it once per host AI tool that supports rules. A sibling of `04-skill-generate` for the rule artifact.

## When to use

- The user wants to write, add, or refactor a rule, a convention, or a coding standard.
- Scan a codebase and propose rules.
- Not for other artifacts (skills, agents, commands, hooks).
