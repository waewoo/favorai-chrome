# Project Memory

Bootstraps the project's context layer: the AI context files with a memory block, the `aidd_docs/` structure, and the memory bank.

## Actions

| #   | Action              | Role                                                | Input             |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 01  | `init-context-file` | Resolve the tools, then upsert the memory block     | project root      |
| 02  | `scaffold-docs`     | Create the `aidd_docs/` folder structure            | project root      |
| 03  | `generate-memory`   | Detect the capabilities, generate the memory files  | the memory dir    |
| 04  | `review-memory`     | Review the memory files for consistency             | the memory dir    |
| 05  | `sync-memory`       | Fill the memory block in every context file         | the context files |

Run the actions in order, `01 → 05`, and run each action's `## Test` before the next.

## Memory rules

Govern the content of every memory file.

- Capture the macro and the non-derivable: decisions, conventions, gotchas, the why. Never restate a schema or a file tree. Point to the code over a copy.
- One fact, one file: define it in its home, elsewhere reference it. Naming a shared lib in its own concern is fine.
- Keep each file small. Short bullets, code in backticks, no version in a tech name (`React`, not `React 19`).
- Reflect the current state only. Drop an unused section, never leave a placeholder.

## Action rules

Govern how every action runs.

- Read an asset or reference relative to this skill. If one can't be read, stop and say so, never invent.
- Ask before anything ambiguous. Never default silently.
- End with a short report of what changed.

## References

- `references/mapping-ai-context-file.md`: the per-tool context-file path.
- `references/memory-block.md`: the context-file memory block and its upsert cases.
- `references/capability-signals.md`: the capabilities, their signals, and the concerns each gates.

## Assets

- `assets/AGENTS.md`: the context-file template.
- `assets/README.md`, `assets/GUIDELINES.md`, `assets/CONTRIBUTING.md`: the `aidd_docs/` doc templates.
- `assets/templates/memory/`: the memory templates, one folder per capability (`core` always, the rest gated by signal).
