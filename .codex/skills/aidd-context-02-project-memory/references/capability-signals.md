# Capability signals

The memory bank is shaped by the concerns the project genuinely has, not by a single project type. The templates live in one folder per capability under `assets/templates/memory/`. The folder is the gate: generate `core/` always, plus the folder of each capability the project has.

A capability holds when a concrete fact in the repo matches the capability's **definition**. The listed signals are canonical evidence, not a closed set: an equivalent concrete fact (a dedicated module, a set of ports) counts too. What never counts is an inferred dominant domain ("it is a web app, so it probably has auth"). There is no fallback type and no `unknown`. Every fire is shown to the user with its evidence at the Confirm step, so a judged match is never silent.
